# Udacity FEND Matching Game
## Project 2

A memory matching game written in HTML, CSS, and JS. 

### How to Play

Flip two cards in the deck to see if the symbols on them match. If they don't, the cards will flip back over, and the objective is to remember where they are. Continue flipping pairs of cards, trying to find the matching symbols. When the cards match, the symbol will remain showing. 

Upon flipping the first card, a timer shown at the top of the screen will begin. As the move counter goes up, a rating system will be triggered. Too many moves will drop the star rating down. 

When the player has found all the matches, a popup window will notify them of their victory. It will provide the information of the time they beat the game in, the number of moves, and their star rating. It will then ask them if they would like to play again.
